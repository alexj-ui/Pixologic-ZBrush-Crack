# Pixologic ZBrush For Window

ZBrush is a professional digital sculpting software developed by Pixologic, now part of Maxon. It combines 3D modeling, texturing, and painting tools into one seamless workflow. Unlike traditional polygon-based modeling tools, ZBrush uses a technology called Pixol, which captures depth, color, and lighting information in every stroke.
